This is my second attempt at generating dance animation with a procedural
method (I tried it a few years ago). This is not a complex algorithm, nor
involved any AI-ish techniques. These characters are controlled with a few of
sin curves and Perlin noise functions. The standard [humanoid IK rig] is used
to animate the model.
